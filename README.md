# api.idleuser.com

This API was created using [Slim 4](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/) with [Slim-Skeleton](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton) to get started. This is my first attempt at creating an API. It took me a while to understand how Slim 4 worked, but once it clicked, everything became an ease. The only work from that point on was figuring out a good routing structure.

The purpose of this API is to provide a central point for my existing projects that relied on their own database handlers. I had various projects in different languages, so you can see how creating and maintaining their database handler can be tiresome.

All end points below are available on https://api.idleuser.com/.
